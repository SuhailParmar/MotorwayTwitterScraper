# MotorwayTwitterScraper

This is the first part of collecting data from motorway cameras. There are a numerous amount of cameras all along each english motorway. The cameras are paired with a twitter bot, which reports any incidents on the road. This app will obtain the tweets from the twitter accounts and convert them into a 'message'.
